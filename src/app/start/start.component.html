              My name is Jimmy and I'm a developer for almost six years now. I'm
              proficient with SharePoint, C# with ASP.NET, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
              I've worked in small and large teams using agile methods (SCRUM, KanBan,
              TDD) and mostly with Microsoft TFS + Subversion. <br />From time to time I
              dabble into Java, SQL and read about Software patterns and IT security.
              <br />Lately it's all been about web development with the MEAN stack, AWS
              and git.
            </p>

              This is my place of learning and training. Here you can see my hobby
              projects and some of my skills in action. I work in github so you can

              I have plans for other projects and things to learn, check them out on the
