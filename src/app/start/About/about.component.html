      My name is Jimmy Quach and I'm a developer for almost six years now. I'm
      proficient with SharePoint, C# with ASP.NET, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
      I've worked in small and large teams using agile methods (SCRUM, KanBan,
      TDD) and mostly with Microsoft TFS + Subversion. <br />From time to time I
      dabble into Java, SQL and read about Software patterns and IT security.
      <br />Lately it's all been about web development with the MEAN stack, AWS
      and git.

      This is my place of learning and training. Here you can see my hobby
      projects and some of my skills in action. My work can be found on github so you can
      follow the progress and development of this site/app on: <br />
      <a href="https://github.com/Gimpan/mean-labs"
        >github.com/Gimpan/mean-labs</a
      >
      <br />
      I have plans for other projects and things to learn, check them out on the
      TODO section or Labnotes.
